# Introduction to Data Science Using R


A repository to house materials for a 1-day course introducing participants to data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).


The goal of this 1-day workshop is to teach new-to-programming data professionals to import data, clean up and summarize a data set, and make some static data visualizations using the program R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R for data analysis, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of R and scientific computing.


### Learning Objectives

- An introduction to R & RStudio
- How to set up a project using RStudio
- An introduction to basic R syntax and the tidyverse
- How to get help in R
- How to import and export tabular data in common formats
- How to look at data in R & RStudio
- How to manipulate a data frame
- How to make and save plots
- How to get help using reproducible example
