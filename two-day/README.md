# Introduction to Data Science Using R


A repository to house materials for a 2-day course introducing participants to data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).


The goal of this 2-day workshop is to teach _new-to-programming_ data professionals to import data, clean up and summarize a data set, and make some static data visualizations using the program R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R for data analysis, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of R and scientific computing.
