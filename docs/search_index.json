You can search using the [r] tag. Google If you can’t find the answer, there are a few useful tools to help you ask a question on-line or from your peers in bcgov. bcgov Yammer channels (e.g. R, Data Science CoP) bcgov RocketChat #rstats channel 10.1 Help People Help You Whan starting a conversation about code, there are a few things that when included make that conversation more efficient and pleasant for everyone: some sample data the not-working code (with comments, white-space, indents == make it easy to read) information about your computing environment, like your operating system, version of R, the packages you have loaded ?dput Will dump the data you’re working with into a format so that it can be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session. library(readr) cats &lt;- read_csv(file = &quot;data/feline-data.csv&quot;) dput(cats) cats &lt;- structure(list(coat = c(&quot;calico&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;tabby&quot;), weight = c(2.1, 5, 3.2), likes_string = c(1, 0, 1)), class = c(&quot;spec_tbl_df&quot;, &quot;tbl_df&quot;, &quot;tbl&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;), row.names = c(NA, -3L), spec = structure(list( cols = list(coat = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_character&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), weight = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_double&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), likes_string = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_double&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;))), default = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_guess&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), skip = 1), class = &quot;col_spec&quot;)) sessionInfo() ## R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS Mojave 10.14.6 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_CA.UTF-8/en_CA.UTF-8/en_CA.UTF-8/C/en_CA.UTF-8/en_CA.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] compiler_3.6.1 magrittr_1.5 bookdown_0.13 tools_3.6.1 ## [5] htmltools_0.3.6 rstudioapi_0.10 yaml_2.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.2 ## [9] stringi_1.4.3 rmarkdown_1.15 knitr_1.25 stringr_1.4.0 ## [13] xfun_0.9 digest_0.6.21 evaluate_0.14 Will print out your current version of R, as well as any packages you have loaded.

You have read the error message but it was not helpful, you used ?ggplot2, and looked on-line and I still cannot find an answer. Maybe someone in the bcgovR community knows? We need to invest a bit of time making the buggy code shareable – the easier it is for someone to run the code, the easier – and likely faster – someone might be able to provide some help. If the data is shareable (e.g. available in the B.C. Data Catalogue with appropriate licence, publicly available) then we can use dput(): library(readr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) cats &lt;- structure(list(coat = c(&quot;calico&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;tabby&quot;), weight = c(2.1, 5, 3.2), likes_string = c(1, 0, 1)), class = c(&quot;spec_tbl_df&quot;, &quot;tbl_df&quot;, &quot;tbl&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;), row.names = c(NA, -3L), spec = structure(list( cols = list(coat = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_character&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), weight = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_double&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), likes_string = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_double&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;))), default = structure(list(), class = c(&quot;collector_guess&quot;, &quot;collector&quot;)), skip = 1), class = &quot;col_spec&quot;)) cats %&gt;% select(coat, weight) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = coat, y = weight)) %&gt;% geom_col() ## Error: `mapping` must be created by `aes()` ## Did you use %&gt;% instead of +?
